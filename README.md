Part 1 - Project Proposal

20 Points - Due: Mar. 1 @ 11:00pm

Requirements
Your project proposal should consist of at least 500 words (max. 1000) describing the overal goals of your project, the neural network
technologies you intend to use, the potential data or data sets you intend to leverage, and the kinds of tests you would like to perform to
verify that your final product works as intended. Remember, these are not detailed technical descriptions, but you should provide enough
detail to convince a professor (or manager) that you have an feasible idea and that you know how to determine the success of your idea
in a both a quatitative and qualitative manner.
Advice
Constructing a proposal is a good way to start a project since it forces you to think about all of the key components that make up a
complete project, and how they will fit together as a whole. It might also bootstrap the process of assigning roles for different team
members and individual work assignments. Every team member's input should be collected for this assignment, but it is natural for certain
team members to take on different roles. Some people may decide to take the technical lead and develop the core code and tests for the
technical direction of the project. Others may decide to take a managerial role in order to provide support in writing up the relevant
milestone reports or other project reporting (including this document, the paper, peer-reviews, etc.). Even though you are not required to
report these contributions for this assignment, your first milestone report will require that you have have worked some of these issues so
it's good to look just beyond
Rubric
1. Does your project have a specific or focused aim (or set of aims)? (5 points)
2. Does your proposal exposit the specific role that neural networks will play in the project? (2 points)
3. Does your project have a specific set of data (or data sets) identified? (6 points)
4. Does your proposal describe a verifiable testing protocol? In order words, did you describe a set of specific tests that you could run
for collecting data and/or statistics which can discriminate between success or failure at meeting the specific aim of the project in
both a quantitative and qualitative manner? (7 points)
Submission
Your project proposal should be constructed in an iPython notebook file (.ipynb) consisting of only markdown cells, should be aptly named
(eg. Project Proposal.ipynb), and should be committed to the project repository for your team (eg. S18-team0-project) in the top directory of the repository.
