## Motivation

Short description

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Your machine needs to have the following installed for this project:
1. Python 3.3 or better. This is required to run the Jupyter Notebook. You can find the latest version on https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Jupyter Notebook. The source file including the demo is written in the Jupyter Notebook. You can find instructions on how to install Jupyter Notebook on https://jupyter.org/install

3. TensorFlow. This is required for Keras. You can find instructions on how to install on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

4. Keras. This project used keras libraries. You can find instructions on how to install on https://keras.io/#installation

### Installing

Once you have your environment ready. You can clone the project

From command line with this command:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:CSCI4850/S18-team2-project.git
```

## Demo
You can find a demo of the project in the subdirector "Demo". There should be two files in there. The first will be an python Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb) that includes the source code of the demo with explanation, and the second will be a sample data (.csv) required for the demo.

To run a script in jupter notbook, you need to press "Shift + Enter" in the specified cell. For example if to run "Hello World!", you need to write the script in the cell like:
![alt text](/image/print.jpg)
But it won't be executed until the "Shift + Enter(Return)". After execution it should look something like this:
![alt text](/image/print2.jpg) This is important to remember when going through the demo. If you only press "Enter(Return)" it will start a new line within the same cell.

**You need to satisfy the [prerequisites](#Prerequisites) to avoid any errors while running the demo.**
